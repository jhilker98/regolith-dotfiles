#+title: Jmacs (Jacob's Literate Emacs Config)
#+author: Jacob Hilker
#+startup: fold
#+property: header-args :tangle jmacs.el

Welcome to JMacs! This is a my personal configuration of emacs, for solo RPG campaigns like [[https://www.ironswornrpg.com/][Ironsworn]], writing (both prose and code), and for general use. I have organized this file into different sections, such as the functions I use, the UI settings, etc.


* Initialization
** Early Initialization
:properties:
:header-args: :tangle early-init.el 
:end:
*** Disabling Package.el 
By default, I want to use straight.el as my package manager.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+end_src

** General Initialization
:properties:
:header-args: :tangle init.el
:end:
*** Setting Up Straight.el
I am using straight.el for my packages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
(expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
(bootstrap-version 5))
(unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
(with-current-buffer
    (url-retrieve-synchronously
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
    'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
(goto-char (point-max))
(eval-print-last-sexp)))
(load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+end_src

*** Setting Up Use-Package with Straight.el
Use-package provides an easy-to-use macro - I like that, but want the functionality of straight.el.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+end_src

And finally, I always want it to use straight.el.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq straight-use-package-by-default t)
#+end_src

*** Org Mode
I want to use the newest version of org-mode instead of the one built in to emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(org-contrib))
#+end_src
And finally, I want to load the literate config.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file "~/.jmacs/jmacs.org")
#+end_src



* Initial Setup
This is where I setup my initial personal information, as well as a minimal UI and enabling the visual bell.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Jacob Hilker"
      user-mail-address "jacob.hilker2@gmail.com"
      visible-bell t)

#+end_src

Now I want to disable automatic indentation with electric-indent-mode, and disable tabs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(electric-indent-mode -1)
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
#+end_src

I also only want horizontal splits - none of this vertical split business unless I say so.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

** Y/N for Yes/No
I also want to use y/n for answering yes or no.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+end_src

** Emoji
Sometimes I want to add an emoji.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emojify
:hook (after-init . global-emojify-mode))
#+end_src

** Time And Date Modeline Format
I want to show the time, but not the mail or system load.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-time-default-load-average nil
      display-time-mail-string ""
      display-time-format "%H:%M %a, %d %b")
#+end_src

* Minor Tweaks
** Tab in Insert Mode Indents
I want to insert indents myself.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t
      org-src-fontify-natively t
      org-src-tab-acts-natively t)

(setq-default tab-width 2)
#+end_src

*** Smarttab
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package smart-tab
  :init
  (smart-tab-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Scratch Buffer Uses Org Mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq initial-major-mode 'org-mode
      initial-scratch-message nil)
#+end_src


** TODO Keep Folders Clean
I don't mind having auto-save files, but not in the current directory. I also don't want any lockfiles.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(expand-file-name ".tmp/backups/" user-emacs-directory))))
(setq create-lockfiles nil)
;; auto-save-mode doesn't create the path automatically!
(make-directory (expand-file-name ".tmp/auto-saves/" user-emacs-directory) t)
;
(setq auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name ".tmp/auto-saves/sessions/" user-emacs-directory)
      auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,(expand-file-name ".tmp/auto-saves/" user-emacs-directory) t)))
#+end_src

** Battery and Time In Modeline
I want to display the battery if I am on a laptop. In addition, I want to display the time.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jh/emacs-init ()
  "Function that sets up time display and battery display, if applicable."
  (display-battery-mode 1))

  (ivy-mode 1))
#+end_src

***** Ivy Posframe
Ivy Posframe makes it much easier to edit the ivy ui.

  (smartparens-global-mode))
#+end_src

*** Rainbow Delimiters
Rainbow Delimiters makes it so that parenthesis and other characters have their own colors - making it easier to follow the parenthesis, especially in something like lisp where there are so many parenthesis.

(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :hook ((prog-mode) . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+end_src

* Org Mode
Org-Mode is THE absolute best thing about Emacs, in my humble opinion. Being able to keep notes and an agenda in the same file is so much easier than something like Notion which is pretty resource-intensive and is much harder to organize (in my opinion, at least). I highly respect what they are doing, but I prefer org-mode. My workflow is very much still in progress - for now, it's sort of a mix of GTD and my own thing. It will probably be constantly changing until I find what works for me.
** Initial Setup
This is a very basic function that sets up org-mode to use visual line mode, org-indent mode, and variable-pitch mode - just a few minor ui tweaks. It’s not really enough for me to put under the UI Tweaks section, though. I'm also requiring org-capture because I was getting a weird error about capture-templates being void.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jh/org-mode-setup ()
    "Makes a few minor ui adjustments for org-mode."
    (visual-line-mode 1)
    (variable-pitch-mode 1)
    (org-indent-mode 1))
    
(defun jh/org-agenda-setup ()
  "Cleans up the agenda view."
  (setq org-agenda-start-day "-0d"))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'jh/org-mode-setup)
#+end_src

** UI Tweaks
Org-mode has a very nice UI out of the box - however, there are a few things I would tweak about it just to get a better view for myself.
*** Cleaner View
I want to hide formatting characters (like forward-slashes for italics and asterisks for bold, as an example) and any leading stars for a nested heading (like a second-level header under a first-level heading). In addition, I want to use an arrow as my ellipsis, instead of the default three periods.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t
      org-hide-leading-stars t
       org-ellipsis " ▼ ")
#+end_src

*** Clearer Faces
I like having different colors for different level headings - by default, in the doom-gruvbox theme, both first and second-level headings are green, which is harder for me to follow even I have text indented.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil :foreground "#83a598")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil :foreground "#d3869b")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-3 nil :foreground "#fabd2f")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-4 nil :foreground "#fb4934")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-5 nil :foreground "#83a598")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-6 nil :foreground "#d3869b")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-7 nil :foreground "#fabd2f")
(set-face-attribute 'org-level-8 nil :foreground "#fb4934")
#+end_src

*** Nicer Bullets
I want to see an actual bullet point instead of a minus sign.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                        '(("^ +\\([-*]\\) "
                           (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

(font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                        '(("^ +\\([+*]\\) "
                           (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

#+end_src

** Packages
Org-mode has a ton of packages that can extend it.
*** Built-In Packages
This section sets up any packages that are include with org-mode out of the box.

**** Org Tempo
Org Tempo lets me use <key(tab) to insert blocks into an org-mode document. As an example, I could use <s(tab) to insert a source code block.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-tempo
    :straight nil
    :ensure nil)
#+end_src

**** Org Capture
So I can quickly capture ideas.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-capture
  :ensure nil
  :straight nil)
#+end_src

*** Decide Mode 
Decide Mode allows me to quickly roll dice if I am in a campaign or need to choose something.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Deft
Deft allows me to sort through my org-roam notes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package deft)
#+end_src

*** DOCT
Declarative Org Capture Templates (aka DOCT) allows me to more easily create capture templates.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package doct
  :commands (doct))
#+end_src

*** Export Backends
**** Hugo
I use hugo for my website, and having it in org-mode is great. In addition, being able to keep a blog pot in a subtree in one org-mode file makes it easier to find, in my opinion.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
:after ox)
#+end_src

**** Pandoc
Seems fairly straightforward - this allows me to export an org-mode file using pandoc.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-pandoc
:after ox)
#+end_src

*** Org Appear
This package makes it much easier to edit Org documents when org-hide-emphasis-markers is turned on. It temporarily shows the emphasis markers around certain markup elements when you place your cursor inside of them. No more fumbling around with = and * characters! (description credit to [[https://config.daviwil.com/emacs][David Wilson]] of the [[https://youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters][System Crafters]] youtube channel).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autolinks t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autoentities t))
#+end_src

*** Org Protocol

*** Org QL
Org QL allows me to define queries for org-mode files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-ql)
#+end_src

*** Org-Ref
Org-Ref allows me to add citations to my files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Org Roam
Org Roam allows-me to keep a roam-style braindump like in notion.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/anaconda3/bin") ;; since ubuntu is using the sqlite3 in anaconda - idk why but it is

(use-package org-roam
  :hook (org-mode . org-roam-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-roam-db-location "~/org/roam/org-roam.db"
        org-roam-directory "~/org/roam"))
#+end_src

*** Org Super Agenda
Org Super Agenda allows me to group items in the agenda much more easily than I can by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-super-agenda
:config 
(org-super-agenda-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** Org Superstar
Org-superstar lets me use nicer bullets for my headers and formatting.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-superstar
  :hook (org-mode . org-superstar-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("●" "○")
        org-superstar-special-todo-items t
        org-superstar-todo-bullet-alist '(("TODO" . ?☐)
                                         ("DONE" . ?))))
#+end_src

*** TOC-Org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package toc-org
  :hook (org-mode . toc-org-mode))
#+end_src

** General Configuration
I keep my agenda files in Dropbox so that I can access them on any computer. In addition, I break my agenda files down into several smaller files - =projects.org= for larger projects, =todo.org= for small scale tasks (stuff like "take out the trash, etc"), =contacts.org= for any birthdays, and =agenda.org= for any general calendar items like a meeting or a campaign. 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/Dropbox/org"
      org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/org/agenda.org" "~/Dropbox/org/projects.org" "~/Dropbox/org/contacts.org" "~/Dropbox/org/todo.org")
      org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d!)")
                          (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)"))
      org-todo-keyword-faces '(
                               ("TODO" . (:foreground "#cc241d" :weight bold :underline t))
                               ("NEXT" . (:foreground "#fe8019" :weight bold))
                               ("DONE" . (:foreground "#83a598" :weight bold :strike-through t))
                               ("WAITING" . (:foreground "#d3869b" :weight bold :slant italic))
                               ("CANCELLED" . (:foreground "#83a598" :weight bold :strike-through t))
                               ))      
#+end_src

** Categories and Tags
I use categories and tags to help me organize my work. Categories are what I use more for a context (such as appointments, projects, etc) and a tag is something more narrow within that project. This is where I define my global tags - such as a personal context, or something for work, or for family. In addition, I also use tags to represent the status of a project, such as whether it's active, or on the backlog, etc.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-tag-persistent-alist '(
                                 ;; Project Contexts
                                 (:startgroup)
                                 ("@personal" . ?p)
                                 ("@work" . ?w)
                                 (:endgroup)
                                 ;; Project Status
                                 (:startgroup)
                                 ("backlog" . ?b)
                                 ("plan" . ?P)
                                 ("ready" . ?r)
                                 ("active" . ?a)
                                 ("review" . ?v)
                                 ("completed" . ?c)
                                 (:endgroup)
                                 ("meeting" . ?m)
                                 ("email" . ?e)
                                 ("inbox" . ?i)))
#+end_src

** Custom Agenda Commands
I have a few agenda commands I like to use - primarily, a dashboard and a planner, although I do have a project kanban board for any projects I am working on. Right now, all my agenda commands are based around my personal schedule. But first, I just want to clear all of the built in agenda commands so that I can add them to my list.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands nil)
#+end_src
*** TODO Mini-Calendar
I really like the implementation of [[https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/nbaolx/interactive_miniagenda_using_a_minicalendar_in_a/][this calendar mini-agenda]] by [[https://old.reddit.com/user/Nicolas-Rougier][/u/Nicolas-Rougier]] on the emacs subreddit - I am going to try and implement my own version here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Dashboard
This dashboard view allows me to get a view of my day and the next 2 days, along with my todo items.
