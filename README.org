* My dotfiles
These are my personal configurations for various applications. I will keep this as up-to-date as I can. Don't even try to understand these, they are kind of a mess tbh.

* Archive Notice
As of 21 November, 2021, I am not using regolith linux any more - I have decided to try Endeavour OS. This repo is no longer being updated, but feel free to try these config files out if you use Regolith Linux, or if you don't care about my WM configs, in your own setups. 

* Installation :TOC: 
For most of these programs, the installation is quite simple - copy the =.config= folder into your =~/.config= folder. For bash, I do have conda installed for my data science class, but don't feel like you have to use it - you are free to delete that section from the bashrc. You will need to install [[https://regolith-linux.org/][Regolith Linux]] for the window manager - I highly recommend it for someone new to tiling WMs.  

 
* Notes :TOC:
 - The color scheme is from pywal.
 - For my word count format, you will have to manually change the format of the word count section in doom modeline from =%dW= to =%d words=.
 - You will need to create a subdirectory in ~/Music and call it alerts. Find a wav file you like and save it as alert.wav in the alerts directory. I am using [[http://soundbible.com/2154-Text-Message-Alert-1.html][this]] as my alert sound, but use whatever you want.
 - Since I installed NCspot as a snap app, my config file goes in =~/snap/ncspot/17/.config/ncspot=.
- The dictionary goes in =~/.vim/spell/=
* Bugs :TOC:
 - TOC-Org is unavailable
   - While I haven't been able to fix this yet, I am trying to fix this. I have had no luck so far with it being installed from the =jmacs.org= file.

  * FAQ :TOC:
 - Why no Mutt config?
   - I used Luke Smith's [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard][Mutt Wizard]] for configuring my mutt.
 - What music player are you using?
   - Primarily NCSpot, though I do use Tizonia as well if I need something even more minimalist, such as when I'm studying. I'm not sharing the Tizonia config because that config is mostly passwords and such - very easy to configure IMO.
